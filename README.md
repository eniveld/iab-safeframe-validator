=======================

The IAB SafeFrame Validator is an interactive web service that provides a SafeFrame compatible web site container in which advertisers can easily place their ad units, and validate whether their ad units function properly.  The validator performs some level of automated testing and produces a report for the advertiser alerting them to any issues with their SafeFrame compatibility.  In addition, the advertiser can visually see and interact with their ad unit and manually verify whether the unit is functioning properly.
